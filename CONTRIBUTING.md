## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:
  * We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

Thanks
